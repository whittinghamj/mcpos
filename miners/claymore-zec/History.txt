- added "-i 7" and "-i 8" values, about 1% speedup, but can be unstable in some cases.
- added SSL/TLS encryption support for better security, see "-zpool" option description in Readme file for details.
- added "License.txt" file that contains the License Agreement.
- added "-v" option.
- several bug fixes and minor improvements.
- EthMan: improved saving options.



v8.0
---------------------------------------------------------------------

- improved speed by about 15-25% (depends on card model). Up to 300H/s on stock 390X.
- added "-i 5" and "-i 6" values, 1-2% speedup, but can be unstable in some cases.

- some bug fixes and minor improvements.



v7.0
---------------------------------------------------------------------

- improved speed by about 15-25% (depends on card model). About 230H/s on stock 390X.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

- improved speed by about 30-50% (depends on card model). About 145H/s on stock 390X.
- improved support for Catalyst 16.x and 4xx cards.
- reduced CPU usage.



v4.0
---------------------------------------------------------------------

- improved speed by about 20% (depends on card model). Up to 100H/s on stock 390X on "-i 2" mode.
